## About me

I'm a data scientist/computational biologist/machine learning engineer/general data enthusiast broadly interested in extracting actionable information from noisy datasets through the development of efficient data pipelines, explanatory and predictive models, and appealing visualizations.

I'm currently a Data Scientist at [Indigo Agriculture](https://www.indigoag.com/), where I develop methods and tools for analyzing microbiome datasets generated by amplicon sequencing experiments. 

The primary goal of my work at Indigo is to model the complex relationships between microbe abundances and the health of their host plants using a blend of modern machine learning methods and statistical inference techniques.

Previously, I was a staff scientist in the [Neale lab](http://www.nealelab.is/), located at the [Analytical and Translational Genetics Unit (ATGU)](http://www.atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/) at Massachusetts General Hospital and the [Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research](https://www.broadinstitute.org/stanley) at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.

In the Neale lab, my work focused on using statistical methods and computational techniques to elucidate the genetics underlying human traits and diseases.

Prior to joining the Neale lab, I was a Data Scientist in the [InsightStudio](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/deloitte-analytics/solutions/deloitte-insightstudio.html) at Deloitte Consulting, where I developed dashboard visualizations for clients, designed database queries to feed those dashboards.

During a summer internship with the Data Science and Analytics team at [TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/), I worked on developing a new table in the group's data warehouse and creating a dashboard to visualize its content.

I've also worked as a Research Associate at [Eaton Vance Management](https://www.eatonvance.com/), where I conducted fundamental research on issuing companies in the leveraged loan market.

I received a Master of Science in Applied Statistics from the University of Michigan and a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics from Williams College.
